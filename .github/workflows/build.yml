# This workflow is named 'Build and Push Docker Image'
name: Build and Push Docker Image

# This specifies when the workflow should run
on:
  push:
    # It will trigger on any push to the 'main' branch
    branches:
      - main
  # You can also trigger it manually from the GitHub Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow is composed of one or more jobs that run in parallel.
# Here, we define a single job.
jobs:
  build-and-push-docker-image:
    # This job will run on the latest version of Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # The steps define the sequence of commands and actions to be executed
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code from your repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Java, which is required to build the Quarkus project
      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: 'maven'

      # Step 3: Log in to Docker Hub using GitHub secrets
      # These secrets must be configured in your repository settings
      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN }}

      # Step 4: Build the Quarkus native executable with Maven
      - name: Build Quarkus Native Executable
        run: ./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true

      # Step 5: Define the Docker image tags
      - name: Get commit SHA as tag
        id: commit_sha
        run: echo "TAG=$(echo ${{ github.sha }} | cut -c1-7)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # Step 6: Build the Docker image from the native executable
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |

      # Step 7: Push the newly built Docker image to Docker Hub
      - name: Push Docker image
        run: |
